### Hi there, I'm Soham ðŸ‘‹

## I'm obsessed with piano, startups, and leveraging LLMs and fintech APIs to build cool things!

Currently busy growing startups and building cool dashboards!

I'm currently working on:
- Finance Portfolio Generator, a tool to help average folks learn about investing and build their own custom portfolios!
- Finding pianos on campus to play some cool jazz and blues improv!
- Getting in the best shape of my life by working out daily and adventuring out for some nourishing food!

I'm currently learning about:
- Machine Learning (specifically how LLMs work, vector databases, all that good stuff!)
- How Startups work (fundraising from VC's and angel investors, managing the business, securing contracts, etc
